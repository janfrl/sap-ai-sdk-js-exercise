# Exercise 0 - Preparation

This short exercise helps you get the project running and explains how the chat API works.

### 1. Install Dependencies
Run the following command in the repository root:
```bash
pnpm install
```
This installs all Nuxt and SAP AI SDK packages.

### 2. Start the Development Server
Use Nuxt's dev command:
```bash
pnpm dev
```
The server automatically reloads when files change, so no manual restarts are required.

### 3. Understand `server/api/chats/[id].post.ts`
Open [`server/api/chats/[id].post.ts`](../../server/api/chats/%5Bid%5D.post.ts). The route performs these steps:
1. **Validate the request** using `zod` to ensure `model`, `config` and message list are provided.
2. **Create an `OrchestrationClient`** by calling `runTask` with the selected config. If no config is provided, the route falls back to the `config:default` task, which creates a very simple client. The tasks from later exercises return this client instance.
3. **Load or create the chat** from the database and generate a title on the first message using the LLM.
4. **Persist the user's message** and stream the assistant response back to the browser using Serverâ€‘Sent Events.
5. **Store the assistant reply** once streaming is complete.

Having this context will help you understand how the configurations from the following exercises are used when chatting.
